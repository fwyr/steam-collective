                                    Honestly? Stressful at times. Most of us have spent several painstaking hours in the final weeks leading up to a competition or an event (like our open house!), and a lot of effort is funnelled into planning and executing things. Not to mention, we often deal with time and manpower constraints, which can hinder us severely.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Yet, the payoff of these experiences makes the grinding all the more worthwhile. The satisfaction of stepping up onto a podium to receive an award, of seeing an event being carried out successfully without a hitch, of the joyous laughter and cheers that we share with each other, only strengthens our identity as a collective, and as a group of people who can manage to pull off great things, even when the going gets tough.
                                    <br><br>
                                    We often tire ourselves, but as the old adage goes, no pain, no gain. Being a STEAM Collective member allows us to learn a multitude of skills that would otherwise never be taught in a traditional classroom. Though we sometimes disagree with each other, we resolve our arguments, tightening the bonds that make us the CCA that we are. Granted, being a STEAM Collective member is hard work, but there's no question that it's rewarding beyond words.
